INTRODUCTION

State-­of-­the-­art exoskeleton control architectures increasingly use
data-­driven techniques to provide more effective assistance during
human movement compared with their heuristic counterparts. In
these approaches, data-­driven models are trained to map data from
exoskeleton-­mounted sensors to human states [e.g., speed (1, 2), gait
phase (3–5), locomotion mode (6, 7), kinematics (8, 9), and joint
moments (10–12)], environmental conditions [e.g., ground slope
(2, 13) or terrain (14, 15)], or human outcomes [e.g., metabolic cost
(16, 17) or user preference (18)]. When sufficient labeled data (data
paired with the correct output values) are available, many of these
data-­driven models, such as deep learning–based controllers, are capable of user independence (i.e., do not require participant-­specific
data) and can apply effective assistance across a wide range of tasks
without requiring task classification (task agnostic) (11, 12). These
advances are pushing exoskeletons closer to handling the human
and environmental uncertainty requisite for real-­world viability.
Despite these successes, a critical barrier to the development and
deployment of these data-­driven controllers remains: A substantial
amount of labeled training data is required, and these labels are costly to obtain for each device. Researchers must record data from their
exoskeleton sensors along with time-­synced data from a ground
truth source, often necessitating optical motion capture systems and

force plates. For instance, these motion and force data are critical to
accurately calculate ground truth biological joint moments, which
have recently emerged as a powerful human state variable in exoskeleton control (11, 12). This highly specialized equipment is not readily available for many roboticists, and the process of calculating joint
moments (or other human state labels) is nontrivial, requiring hundreds of hours of skilled labor for curation of large datasets. The
training data are also device specific, prohibiting the reusage of data
from previous generations or prototypes; every time researchers add
or move sensors or substantially change the control type or magnitude, new labeled data must be collected. Furthermore, the exoskeleton must be actuated during training data collection because of the
nonnegligible effect of assistance on users’ biomechanics and sensor
shifts due to soft tissue deformation and interface compliance. To
accomplish this, researchers often must develop hand-­tuned, task-­
dependent “stand-­in” controllers that approximate the intended
data-­driven controller (11, 12). Thus, progress in exoskeleton control
research is substantially hindered by its dependence on device-­
specific, labeled data, which is only compounded by the short relevance time frame and numerous prohibitive barriers to obtaining
that data.
Transfer learning is a set of techniques that have emerged to address problems like this by leveraging large, related datasets to more
effectively learn to model smaller-­scale, labeled data. For lower-­limb
devices, transfer learning methods have been applied to enable interparticipant and interactivity transfer of deep learning models.
However, these techniques are limited in that some participant-­or
activity-­specific data must exist and the specific sensors must remain the same (19–21). These studies have also been restricted to
off-­device verification. Researchers have also sought to create larger-­
scale, labeled, synthetic datasets for training deep learning networks, but this work has focused on dataset augmentation without

Data-­driven methods have transformed our ability to assess and respond to human movement with wearable robots, promising real-­world rehabilitation and augmentation benefits. However, the proliferation of data-­driven
methods, with the associated demand for increased personalization and performance, requires vast quantities of
high-­quality, device-­specific data. Procuring these data is often intractable because of resource and personnel
costs. We propose a framework that overcomes data scarcity by leveraging simulated sensors from biomechanical
models to form a stepping-­stone domain through which easily accessible data can be translated into data-­limited
domains. We developed and optimized a deep domain adaptation network that replaces costly, device-­specific,
labeled data with open-­source datasets and unlabeled exoskeleton data. Using our network, we trained a hip and
knee joint moment estimator with performance comparable to a best-­case model trained with a complete, device-­
specific dataset [incurring only an 11 to 20%, 0.019 to 0.028 newton-­meters per kilogram (Nm/kg) increase in error
for a semisupervised model and 20 to 44%, 0.033 to 0.062 Nm/kg for an unsupervised model]. Our network significantly outperformed counterpart networks without domain adaptation (which incurred errors of 36 to 45%
semisupervised and 50 to 60% unsupervised). Deploying our models in the real-­time control loop of a hip/knee
exoskeleton (N = 8) demonstrated estimator performance similar to offline results while augmenting user performance based on those estimated moments (9.5 to 14.6% metabolic cost reductions compared with no exoskeleton). Our framework enables researchers to train real-­time deployable deep learning, task-­agnostic models with
limited or no access to labeled, device-­specific data.

models to statistically outperform their counterpart models without
domain adaptation (reducing error by ~15 to 30%) while also achieving accuracies similar (within ~10 to 30%) to those of models trained

allow exoskeleton controllers based on our model estimates to augment human performance, reducing metabolic expenditure by up to
10 to 15% on the basis of the two tasks captured. These are vital and
critical steps toward enabling universal access to data-­driven approaches in wearable robotics.

Performance on the offline testing set
With the small, labeled dataset chosen for the semisupervised case,
we tested the following approaches on a set of eight novel, held-­out
participants performing 28 tasks: the semisupervised and unsupervised baseline (i.e., without domain adaptation), our semisupervised
and unsupervised approach, and the best-­case model (i.e., using costly device-­specific data from all participants and all tasks). For the
semisupervised case, our approach significantly outperformed the
baseline approach at the hip (percentage increase in RMSE compared
with the best case of 11.3% versus the baseline of 35.5%, P < 0.01)
and at the knee (percentage increase in RMSE compared with the
best case of 20.3% versus the baseline of 45.3%, P < 0.01) as seen
in Fig. 3 (A and B). For the unsupervised case, our approach significantly outperformed the baseline approach at the hip (percentage
increase in RMSE compared with the best case of 19.9% versus the
baseline of 49.5%, P < 0.01) and at the knee (percentage increase in
RMSE compared with the best case of 44.4% versus the baseline of
60.3%, P < 0.01) as seen in Fig. 3 (C and D). Figure 3 (E and F) presents a comparison between the baseline and our approach for both
the semisupervised and unsupervised cases in terms of the square
of the Pearson correlation coefficient [R2; on the best fit line between
the ground truth and the estimate (11, 12)]. Each point on the scatter
plot represents one of the 28 tasks where a higher R2 at the hip and
the knee (closer to the top right-­hand corner) indicates a better shape
match between the estimate and the ground truth joint moment.
To further validate that our translation approach works across
different types of estimators, we used our bidirectional translation
approach to train a ground reaction force (GRF) estimator model
(for both the supervised and unsupervised cases) and an activity
classifier (for the unsupervised case). Both models demonstrated
improved performance with our approach as compared with the
baseline (figs. S4 to S6).
Real-­time model performance
We deployed the joint moment estimation models trained with both
our approach and the baseline in real time on an autonomous hip/
knee exoskeleton with the models providing estimated joint moments to assist users (Fig. 4, A and B). The best-­case model estimate
was computed post hoc on the collected data for a fair comparison
and performed similarly to the current state-­of-­the-­art estimators
(fig. S7) (12). Across eight novel users performing eight representative tasks, the model trained with our semisupervised approach significantly outperformed the baseline approach at the hip (percentage
increase in RMSE compared with the best-­case model of 11.0 ± 6.4%
versus the baseline of 37.5 ± 10.5%, P < 0.01) and at the knee (percentage increase in RMSE compared with the best-­case model of
19.5 ± 9.6% versus the baseline of 48.3 ± 19.0%, P = 0.011) (Fig. 4,
C and D). The final performance of our semisupervised approach
was 0.19 ± 0.01 Nm/kg RMSE and 0.71 ± 0.04 R2 at the hip and
0.16 ± 0.02 Nm/kg RMSE and 0.75 ± 0.04 R2 at the knee. For the

Optimization results
To train our semisupervised model, we needed to select a minimal
subset of data for the supervised portion. Given that not all datasets
are equally valuable, we sought to optimize the number of tasks
(e.g., running, jumping, etc.) included in the training set by sequentially adding labeled tasks on the basis of the average generalization
score: a score measuring how well each additional task improved
moment estimation on the other tasks (Fig. 2A). Figure 2B shows
the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) across all tasks
averaged between hip and knee for each task addition. Even after
additional tasks no longer improve generalization, overall RMSE
can continue to decrease because of improvement on that particular
added task. We then compared the performance of our approach
with that of a baseline model with the same number of tasks but
without domain adaptation. Performance is presented as a percentage error increase compared with a best-­case model (i.e., a model
with access to all labeled tasks) for both the hip and knee (Fig. 2, C
and D). Using the optimized set of tasks for both our approach and
the baseline, our approach statistically outperformed the baseline
approach regardless of the number of tasks included.
Although additional tasks continue to improve estimation, the
goal of this optimization was to select a small, labeled subset of data
to use from the target domain. Thus, we chose to limit our semisupervised approach to four tasks based on the plateau in the generalization score (Fig. 2A). The resulting percentage error increase from
the best-­case model at four tasks was 12.0 ± 3.8% at the hip and
13.6 ± 6.9% at the knee. For all future semisupervised analyses, the
baseline and our approach included labeled exoskeleton data from
only four optimized tasks. For our approach, these tasks were calisthenics, jump in place, level ground walk, and twister, whereas the
baseline tasks were level ground walk, standing poses, calisthenics,
and push-­and-­pull recovery (12).
Collecting many tasks is time and labor intensive, as is collecting
additional participants; thus, we also sought to limit the number of
participants included in our small semisupervised dataset. By folding across left-­out participants, we assessed the average performance
benefit of including additional participants. The performances of
the baseline approach versus our approach for the hip and knee are
presented in Fig. 2 (E and F), in terms of percentage increase compared with the same best-­case model as above (all participants and
tasks included). Only the four optimized tasks from above were included for each participant. Regardless of the number of participants included, our approach statistically outperformed the baseline
approach. Given that most of the performance benefits were accrued
during the first several participant additions, we limited the number
of labeled participants who were included for the semisupervised

models. We did this by averaging the hip and knee RMSE for our
approach and determining the number of participants needed to
reach 5% of the RMSE with all 13 participants. This occurred at four
participants with a percentage increase in RMSE compared with the
best case of 13.7 ± 5.2% at the hip and 19.7 ± 9.7% at the knee. Thus,
on the basis of these optimizations, the following semisupervised
models (both our approach and the baseline) included labeled data
from only four participants performing four tasks.

Fig. 2. Task optimization and performance across limited task and participant training sets. After seeding the task optimization with the task that provided the lowest RMSE across all tasks, tasks were sequentially added by maximizing the generalization score to other tasks (A). The corresponding RMSE for unselected and selected
tasks is shown in (B). Optimization was terminated after nine tasks when our approach was not statistically different from the best-­case model. Using this optimized task
list, we compared the performance of our approach at the hip (C) and knee (D) with a separately optimized baseline without domain adaptation (but the same limited
number of tasks). By cross-­folding across participants with four optimized tasks, we assessed the average RMSE for our approach and the baseline for the hip (E) and knee
(F) when sequentially increasing the number of labeled participants used in training. Our approach and the baseline were compared with a best-­case model trained with
labeled data from all tasks and participants. Error bars represent SD across five cross-­folded, left-­out participants [omitted from (A) and (B) for clarity]. Statistical significance was determined by controlling the false rate of discovery (q < 0.05) across all nine tasks [(C) and (D)] and all 13 participants [(E) and (F)].

Fig. 3. Offline model performance for moment estimators trained with translated data. For the semisupervised case, the performance of our approach versus the
baseline is presented for the hip (A) and knee (B) in terms of percentage increase in RMSE compared with the best-­case model. Parallel results are presented for the unsupervised case at the hip (C) and knee (D). Averages were first taken across all 28 activities and then across participants. Error bars represent the SD across eight participants, and asterisks represent statistical significance determined by paired t tests. The R2 values between ground truth joint moment and estimate for each of the 28 tasks
at the hip and knee are presented for the semisupervised case (E) and unsupervised case (F). Each point represents the average across eight participants, but error bars
were omitted for visual clarity; each triangle represents the average across all tasks.

unsupervised case, our approach significantly outperformed the
baseline approach at the hip (percentage increase in RMSE compared
with the best-­case model of 25.6 ± 13.9% versus the baseline of
63.4 ± 24.8%, P < 0.01) and at the knee (percentage increase in RMSE
compared with the best-­case model of 32.9 ± 6.7% versus the baseline of 54.6 ± 8.1%, P < 0.01) (Fig. 4, E and F). The unsupervised
baseline approach was computed post hoc because of the poor estimation of the baseline controller causing instability (fig. S3 and movie
S1) and deemed unfeasible for real-­time performance. The final performance of our unsupervised approach was 0.21 ± 0.01 Nm/kg RMSE
and 0.68 ± 0.04 R2 at the hip and 0.18 ± 0.01 Nm/kg RMSE and
0.71 ± 0.03 R2 at the knee. The data available to each model and the
strategy for using it are depicted in Fig. 4 (G to I).
To understand the effect of these errors on human performance,
we deployed the best-­case model, our semisupervised model, and our
unsupervised model (N = 8) during a weightlifting activity and incline walking and compared metabolic cost relative to no exoskeleton
(Fig. 5, A and B). There were significant differences between controller types for lifting weight [F = 8.54, degrees of freedom (df) = 3,
P < 0.01] and 5° incline walking (F = 11.05, df = 3, P < 0.01). Our
semisupervised model resulted in statistically significant reductions
Scherpereel et al., Sci. Robot. 10, eads8652 (2025)

19 November 2025

in metabolic cost compared with no exoskeleton for both lifting a
weight and 5° inclines (12.5% for lifting and 14.6% for inclines, both
P < 0.01). These reductions were similar to the best-­case model that
also had statistically significant reductions for both tasks (14.4% for
lifting and 13.6% for inclines, both P < 0.01). In addition, our unsupervised model also reduced metabolic cost compared with no
exoskeleton, although it was not statistically significant for eight participants (9.5% for lifting, P = 0.066, and 13.8% for inclines, P = 0.051).
Similar results can be seen between the best-­case and our domain
adaptation models for tasks that did not require high net-­positive
work (fig. S8).
To further understand the accuracy of the three models that we
deployed in real time, we broke down the results into each specific
task. These results are presented in terms of an R2 shape match between the ground truth joint moment and the estimate (Fig. 6A). The
tasks are separated into cyclic, impedance-­like, and unstructured activities to demonstrate the performances across all categories (12). A
one-­way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test found statistical differences between the three real-­time models for R2 at the hip (F = 27.63,
df = 2, P < 0.01) and at the knee (F = 14.47, df = 2, P < 0.01). Follow-­

Fig. 4. Real-­time model performance for moment estimators trained on translated data. Our autonomous hip/knee exoskeleton (A) sends measurements from hip
and knee encoders and thigh and shank IMUs through a microprocessor to an onboard machine learning (ML) coprocessor for real-­time inference. Inference results converted to actuator commands provide bilateral hip and knee assistance. (B) Models with labeled exoskeleton data (semisupervised) included four tasks. Seven real-­time
tasks were novel to the unsupervised and semisupervised models; level ground walking was in the semisupervised training sets. Unlabeled exoskeleton data and biomechanics datasets included all tasks. The performances of our deployed models versus their baselines are presented for the semisupervised case at the hip (C) and knee
(D) and the unsupervised case at the hip (E) and knee (F) as a percentage RMSE increase compared with a best-­case model (computed post hoc). The unsupervised
baseline model was run offline post hoc because of real-­time controller instability. Averages were taken across all eight tested tasks and then across eight participants,
with error bars representing across-­participant SD. Asterisks represent statistical significance determined by paired t tests. Pictorial representations of the data for the
semisupervised models (G), best-­case model (H), and unsupervised models (I) are also presented.

DISCUSSION

These results demonstrate that by leveraging our domain adaptation
strategy to exploit data from the biomechanics domain without an
exoskeleton, we can create useful data-­driven controllers with only
limited or even no access to device-­specific, labeled data. Although
these results are framed in the context of joint moment estimation
for task-­agnostic control, we showed that the sensor translation can
take data without an exoskeleton and replicate characteristics of
exoskeleton data, improving downstream models in the real exoskeleton data domain. This is further supported by our results using
sensor translation to improve GRF estimation and activity classification. This unified framework for incorporating data from many different sources for real-­time deployment has the potential to open
previously unrecognized possibilities in device control by creating a
large dataset for improving current algorithmic techniques and potentially enabling new, more complex deep learning algorithms.
The strong performance of our approach across a variety of tasks
demonstrates its flexibility to improve performance on different size
datasets. The task optimization sweep provides a potential look-­up

table for the number of tasks needed to reach a predefined performance accuracy. There is a tradeoff between the number of labeled
tasks and the corresponding estimator performance with diminishing returns as the number of included tasks increases. However, our
approach reduces the number of training tasks necessary, so much
so that even using nine tasks with the baseline approach has higher
error (hip: 26.2%, knee: 29.2%) than our approach with a single task
(hip: 18.3%, knee: 19.4%). Thus, our approach makes it feasible to
collect far fewer tasks for training. Although the exact optimized
tasks differ from those of the baseline, similar trends appear (level
ground walk and calisthenics are included in both) emphasizing a
diverse set of tasks that covers the extremes of human movement.
Similarly, adding labeled participants improves model performance
but with decreasing benefit from each additional participant. Including four participants of labeled data achieved moment estimation error within 5% of including all 13 participants; therefore, it is
feasible to collect far fewer participants and still achieve comparable
results with our approach.
Although these participant and task sweeps involved testing on a
left-­out participant who was unseen in the training process, aggregate decisions such as hyperparameters were made on the basis of
performance on those participants. Thus, the offline performance of
our models on the truly novel participant set further confirms that
our approach outperforms the baseline approach. When compared
with the best-­case model with access to all of the labeled data, our
semisupervised approach, operating with only 5.1% of the labeled
data (525 thousand labels versus 10.3 million labels), only incurred

models beyond joint moment estimation, as we showed with GRF
estimation and activity classification. This has the potential to enable
faster development and broader use of these powerful techniques.
Our semisupervised approach provides a roadmap for continuing to improve these data-­driven approaches over time. As more
data become available through testing with the initial deployed
model, these data can be efficiently exploited to continue to improve
model performance. For researchers who already have some labeled
data with their device, these results demonstrate a method for incorporating that data into the model. This work shows that with just
four tasks from four participants—a tiny fraction of our overall dataset—estimation error with respect to the best-­case model can be
cut by half compared with having no labeled data.
We propose that our domain adaptation approach is applicable
across many areas of exoskeleton research. Our task optimization results and those from Molinaro et al. (12) demonstrate that having
data from a specific activity continues improving data-­driven approaches for that specific activity even if the additional data do not
promote generalization to other activities. Thus, if researchers and
designers want to add additional functionality for a specific task (e.g.,
a golf swing), at present, they would have to collect exoskeleton data
with that specific task. However, with the framework presented here,
these data could come from an open-­source biomechanics dataset

without incurring data collection and labeling costs. Furthermore,
this approach could be a valuable tool for creating models for unique
populations. It is difficult to collect large participant datasets of
movement for elderly individuals or for those with impaired mobility while wearing a device, but some datasets without a device are
readily available (33–35). Hence, our framework could potentially
make use of those datasets for use on new devices targeted toward
these populations.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, our analysis of the unlabeled
data demonstrated that we had not saturated performance with 10
participants. More benefit may be found from including additional
participants’ unlabeled data and selectively adding or removing unlabeled tasks. Second, only IMUs and encoders were used in translation to avoid using sensors outside the device. Exploring other
sensing modalities beyond kinematics was beyond the scope of this
study. Third, we performed initial optimization of individual network hyperparameters on a network-­by-­network basis; however, additional gain may be found by optimizing those hyperparameters in
the context of the entire network. Fourth, although there is nothing
device specific in our translation method, we only tested our models
on the hip/knee exoskeleton presented. Last, we did not examine the

This paper presents our framework that considers the simulated we propose a two-­part approach.

Training datasets
In training our framework, we chose to estimate hip and knee moments in keeping with Molinaro et al. (12). For exoskeleton sensors,
we chose to use purely kinematic sensors on the thigh and shank.
Thus, our sensor suite consisted of a hip and knee encoder (angle and
velocity) and a thigh and shank inertial measurement unit (IMU).
This mimics the most basic set of mechanical sensors available to a
hip/knee exoskeleton without placing sensors outside the device.
Labeled biomechanics data (without an exoskeleton 𝔻ls ) came
from Scherpereel et al. (39). These data included joint angles, joint
moments, and simulated IMUs on each segment for 12 participants
performing 28 cyclic and noncyclic groups of tasks. We simulated
encoders from the hip and knee inverse kinematics and simulated
IMUs for the thigh and shank, matching IMU locations with those
on our hip/knee exoskeleton.
Exoskeleton data came from Molinaro et al. (12), which included
several phases of collection with 22 different participants. Our unlabeled real exoskeleton data (𝔻ur ) consisted of raw sensor data collected from the exoskeleton, whereas 10 participants performed tasks
without exoskeleton assistance (actuators off). We used the real IMU
data for the thigh and shank (OpenIMU, Tewksbury, MA) and encoder data from the hip and knee (T-­Motor AK80-­9s, Nanchang,
China). For our semisupervised model, we included a combination of
actuated and unactuated data from the first 15 participants across a
range of tasks (𝔻lr). Eight participants from “phase 3” of this dataset
formed our true test set and were used to evaluate performance. No
data from these participants were used to train the models ensuring
that these were novel participants to verify that the models were user
independent. Additional details on modifications to this dataset are
described in the Supplementary Materials.

from the simulated domain (Tr→s) and the other operating in reverse (Ts→r ). Each GAN consisted of a U-­Net–style translator (T ) as
the generator and a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the discriminator ( D).
The GANs were set up bidirectionally, following a CycleGAN
framework (36). Results from image translation and human activity
recognition have demonstrated that bidirectional translation increases performance by encouraging minimal information loss across the
cycle and forcing the translations to be inverses of each other
(29, 36, 37). For moment estimation ME , a temporal convolutional
network (TCN) architecture was selected on the basis of its success in
previous studies (11, 12, 38).
Given the bidirectional nature of the translation, the moment estimator could be trained to operate based on real data ( MEr ) or on
simulated data ( MEs). We found that training the moment estimator
on the real side ( MEr ) outperformed the moment estimator on the
simulated side ( MEs) with the added benefit of only requiring one
model to be deployed in real time (for real-­time implementation,
the moment estimator trained on the simulated side would require
both the real-­to-­simulation translator and the moment estimator to
operate on incoming data). Thus, all results are based on a moment
estimator trained with data that are either converted to or already
in the real domain ( MEr ). The networks are depicted in Fig. 8 along
with the flow of data necessary to compute and combine multiple
training losses. Five different types of losses were available to differing degrees based on the specific case, semisupervised or unsupervised. The rationale and equations for each loss function, the
optimization and tuning of the hyperparameters for the overall
framework, the architecture selection, and further hyperparameter
tuning for the U-­Net, TCN, and CNN architectures are described
in Supplementary Methods and tables S1 and S2. Further details
about training procedures are also included there. An in-­depth
analysis of the value of the GAN loss is provided in the Supplementary Materials and fig. S2.

our no exoskeleton dataset was of similar size. For the baseline model in the semisupervised case, we trained a moment estimator in the
same way as the best-­case model but with only the same limited
number of tasks and limited number of participants that we gave to
our own approach (Fig. 4G). The baseline model in the unsupervised case was trained with only simulated sensor data for participants without an exoskeleton (10 participants and 28 tasks as in
Fig. 4I). These baselines were the best models that could be constructed using traditional supervised learning techniques given the
data limitations.
To report our results, we computed the percentage increase in
error for our algorithm and for the baseline with respect to the best-­
case model as seen in Eq. 1

Real-­time experimental validation
In contrast with offline performance (where previously collected and
held-out data are passed through the model), validating real-­time performance required us to deploy three models in our real-­time controller loop. For the semisupervised case, we chose to deploy both the
baseline and our approach in real time. As explained in the Results
section, four tasks and four participants were selected for use in the
labeled training set. The specific four tasks were based on their respective optimal task ranking. For the unsupervised case, we deployed
only a model trained with our approach. Although we attempted to
deploy the baseline model for this case, the model accuracy with only
simulated data was so poor that the controller was not stable for real-­
time deployment (see movie S1 and fig. S3). To provide a direct offline
comparison, we tested the unsupervised baseline model post hoc with
the same data collected with our real-­time unsupervised model.
To deploy the models in real time, we used the autonomous hip/
knee exoskeleton developed by X, the Moonshot Factory, and detailed in our previous publication (12). Because the moment estimators are directly real-­time deployable, no additional computational
time loss was incurred by running our models compared to our previous work. As in our previous work, a main single board computer
(Raspberry Pi, Cambridge, UK) handled the input/output for the
device and data logging, whereas a separate coprocessor handled
deep learning inference (NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Santa Clara, CA). All
experimenter interaction was handled through an offboard laptop
connected to a Wi-­Fi network hosted by the onboard microprocessor. The device has four actuators (AK809 T-­Motor, Nanchang), two
at the hips and two at the knees for bilateral sagittal plane assistance
at hip and knee. The device and mechatronics are pictured in Fig. 4A.
As in our previous work, the estimated biological moment was converted to applied torque by first scaling the moment (by participant
mass and then by a scaling factor of 20% for the hip and 15% for the
knee), then delaying the torque (by 100 ms for the hip and 50 ms for
the knee), and last filtering the torque using a low-­pass filter (second-­
order Butterworth with a 10-­Hz cutoff frequency) (12).
We performed a protocol similar to that used to collect the training data (12, 39) with a pared-down task list. Eight novel participants
not included in the training or offline testing data (four males, four

females; age: 23.0 ± 3.8 years; height: 173.4 ± 2.6 cm; body mass:
68.2 ± 10.7 kg) performed eight tasks with three different controllers. Informed consent was obtained from each participant under
Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional Review Board protocol H21184. The tasks were split between the three larger task categories used in (12) with seven tasks outside of the labeled training
set for the semisupervised models as seen in Fig. 4B. These tasks
were medicine ball toss [15 lb (6.8 kg) center, right, left], cutting
(left and right, fast and slow), sit-­to-­stand (short and tall chair, with
and without armrests), starting and stopping, stair ascent (slow, normal, fast), stair descent (slow, normal, fast), and walking backward
(0.6, 0.8, 1.0 m/s). More details on the protocols for each task can be
found in our previous dataset publication (39). We also included
one task that was in the training set for the semisupervised models:
level ground walking (0.6 m/s, 1.2 m/s, 1.8 m/s, and shuffle). The
order of the models was randomized and blinded for each participant; all tasks were performed with a single model before switching
models. During each task, exoskeleton data for the encoders (hip
and knee), IMUs (thigh and shank), and the estimated joint moments from the current model were recorded. Motion capture data
were recorded at 200 Hz and GFRs at 1000 Hz.
Data processing was performed in a similar manner to our previous work (12) where participant-­specific musculoskeletal models
were fit to each participant standing in a static pose. The exoskeleton mass was then added for the actuators at their respective joints
and the additional mass was added at the torso. Inverse kinematics
matched the model to the measured motion capture locations, and
inverse dynamics were then calculated on the basis of the GFRs using OpenSim (30, 31). An activity flag was computed to determine
when the activity was occurring and then used as the sections to
assess model performance. Ground truth joint moments were filtered before being compared with the real-­time estimates. Further
details on biomechanical processing and analysis can be found in
our previous work (12, 39).
To assess the real-­time model performance, we captured the
joint moment estimates and then post hoc aligned those estimates
with the ground truth moment labels as in (12). We did not deploy
the best-­case model in real time when collecting data for joint moment accuracy but instead ran the collected sensor signals through
the best-­case model post hoc, thus allowing a fairer comparison of
performance. We did this individually for the data from each model; thus, the best-­case model performance was unique to each specific model’s data (except in the case of the unsupervised baseline as
noted above).
We further assessed human performance outcomes by having
eight novel participants collect metabolic cost measurements during
a lifting task (six males, two females; age: 25.0 ± 3.9 years; height:
174.6 ± 2.4 cm; body mass: 71.0 ± 9.8 kg) and an incline walking task (five males, three females; age: 25.0 ± 2.1 years; height:
175.3 ± 4.2 cm; body mass: 68.9 ± 7.0 kg). Before any metabolic cost
collection, we performed the same acclimation procedure as (12).
For the lifting task, a metronome was set at 10 beats per minute, and
participants were instructed on each tone to use both hands to lift a
25 lb. (11.3 kg) kettle bell weight off a waist-height shelf, touch that
weight to the floor between their feet, and then replace the weight
on the shelf (12). For the incline task, participants walked on a 5°
inclined treadmill at 1.25 m/s. Four conditions were tested for each
activity: our semisupervised model, our unsupervised model, the best-­
case model, and no exoskeleton. Participants performed the activity

S c i e n c e R o b o t i c s | R e s e a r c h Ar t i c l e
for 6 min, and conditions were tested using a within-­participant
counter-­balanced design (ABCD-­DCBA). Because of an exoskeleton malfunction, one incline trial for one participant only lasted
3 min, so a first-­order fit estimate was used for that trial (40, 41) and
averaged with the other 6-­min trial with the same controller. The
order of the three exoskeleton conditions was randomized, and participants were blinded to the condition; however, for a given task,
the no exoskeleton condition was placed either at the beginning (A)
or the end (D) for don and doff efficiency. Motion capture—and
thus ground truth joint moments—was not available during metabolic cost collections. Results for all metabolic cost measurements
are reported on the basis of an average of instantaneous metabolic
cost (as calculated with the Brockway equation) for the final 3 min
of each activity.

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB (MathWorks,
Natick, MA) using a significance level of α = 0.05. For the task and
participant performance sweeps, significance was assessed by controlling the false rate of discovery (q < 0.05) across model conditions (our approach versus the baseline), where percentage RMSE
increase compared with the best case was the dependent variable
(42, 43). We assessed the significance of our approach versus the
baseline with each added task or participant and used the false rate
of discovery to control the family-­wise error rate across all comparisons (9 comparisons for the task case and 13 for the participant case).
For the final offline testing set, we assessed significance using
paired t tests between the baseline and our approach at the hip and
separately at the knee. Percentage RMSE increase compared with
the best case was the dependent variable, which was averaged across
task groups. The independent variable was the model type; participants were the fixed effect.
For real-­time testing, comparisons between the baseline and our
approach were again performed with paired t tests separately for hip
and knee and for the supervised and unsupervised cases. Tests were
performed with percentage RMSE increase compared with the best
case as the dependent variable. Again, the independent variable was
the model type, and participants were the fixed effect. For metabolic
comparisons, we performed repeated one-­way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) tests for each task with participants as the random effect.
This was followed up by planned Bonferroni multiple comparison
tests to compare each controller to the no exoskeleton condition but
not to each other.
To assess the statistical significance for each individual task with
R2 as the dependent variable, we again controlled the false rate of
discovery to account for the number of comparisons between model types (three models were run in real time) and number of tasks
(eight performed in the real-­time validation), thus controlling for all
24 comparisons. Tests were performed with R2 as the dependent
variable separately for each model type with offline versus real time
as the independent variable. We also compared the average performance across all tasks directly between the three models that were
run in real time using a one-­way analysis of variance test with participants as the random effect. This was followed up by Bonferroni
multiple comparison tests between model types. To assess offline
versus real-­time performance, separate two-­sample t tests with assumed equal variance were performed for each deployed model at
each joint to determine whether running the model in real time had
a statistically significant effect on performance.
